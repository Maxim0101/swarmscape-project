# swarmscape-project
Swarmscape is a project hosted by the Northeastern University AI Club. 

We are trying to build an automated greenhouse that leverages software, hardware, and artificial intelligence to solve the following problem:

29% of the world is suffering from food scarcity because of climate change. 
Farmers must find alternatives to regular farming, and greenhouse farming has been proven to be the best solution. 
However, greenhouse farming is less productive, more expensive, and limited in scalability.Â 

Swarmscape is here to fix that. 

In this repository, I will add files that I have worked on.
